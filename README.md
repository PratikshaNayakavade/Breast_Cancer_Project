# Breast_Cancer_Project

**Introduction**: 
Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area. The dataset contains 32 features and is very effective for working on experiments related to breast cancer.The key challenges against itâ€™s detection is how to classify tumors into Benign which is the non-cancerous tumour and Malignant which is cancerous tumour. I used several machine learning algorithms, which will be able to effectively model analysis.

**Conclusions**:
I used to classify breast cancer tumors, machine learning algorithms. The former applied various algorithms, but the most promising algorithm is the support vector machine (SVM). For compared SVM with other algorithms such as K-NN, logistic regression, Random Forest, K-means, GridSearchCV, Decision Tree. They found that the SVM surpassed these methods with accuracy reached 98%
